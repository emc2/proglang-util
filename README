proglang-util
=============

General utility code for implementing programming language frontends
and compilers in Haskell.

This is a base library for a number of other Haskell projects, all of
which are concerned in one way or another with implementing parsers,
type checkers, verifiers, frontends, interpreters, compilers, and
anything else for programming languages using Haskell as the
implementation language (or metalanguage).  That is, this code is
designed to provide a set of tools which one might need in order to
create a new language (or a new realization of an exiting one).

This particular library aims to provide the miscellaneous tools which
are very common in frontend and compiler work.  These include:

 * Indexed symbols
 * A position type
 * A gensym monad
 * A symbol table monad
 * A common class for pretty printing
 * A common mechanism for error reporting
 * Utility code for implementing Alex lexers
 * Code for computing dominance frontiers
